#Formating Subtitles

# We have two standard type to formating subtitles:
# The first is the old formatting used by python 2.0+
# The secound and last is new formatting used by python 3.0+
#
# In the old formatting we use sign "%" inside sentence in place where we want put the argument and outside of sentence where we need to define the argument.
# We cannot use "%" alone, we need use it with correctly type like "%s", "%f" etc.
#
# In the new formatting we use "{}" insted %. We can put "{}" alone or with type inside like "{:f}, {:s} etc.
